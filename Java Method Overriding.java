When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it also inherits its methods; however, it can also override the superclass methods (as well as declare and implement new ones). Consider the following Sports class:

class Sports{
    String getName(){
        return "Generic Sports";
    }
    void getNumberOfTeamMembers(){
        System.out.println( "Each team has n players in " + getName() );
    }
}
Next, we create a Soccer class that inherits from the Sports class. We can override the getName method and return a different, subclass-specific string:

class Soccer extends Sports{
    @Override
    String getName(){
        return "Soccer Class";
    }
}
Note: When overriding a method, you should precede it with the @Override annotation. The parameter(s) and return type of an overridden method must be exactly the same as those of the method inherited from the supertype.

Task
Complete the code in your editor by writing an overridden getNumberOfTeamMembers method that prints the same statement as the superclass getNumberOfTeamMembers method, except that it replaces  with  (the number of players on a Soccer team).

import java.util.*;
class Sports{

    String getName(){
        return "Generic Sports";
    }
  
    void getNumberOfTeamMembers(){
        System.out.println( "Each team has n players in " + getName() );
    }
}

class Soccer extends Sports{
    @Override
    String getName(){
        return "Soccer Class";
    }

    // Write your overridden getNumberOfTeamMembers method here

}

public class Solution{
	
    public static void main(String []args){
        Sports c1 = new Sports();
        Soccer c2 = new Soccer();
        System.out.println(c1.getName());
        c1.getNumberOfTeamMembers();
        System.out.println(c2.getName());
        c2.getNumberOfTeamMembers();
	}
}


Explanation:
Sports Class:

getName: Returns the string "Generic Sports".
getNumberOfTeamMembers: Prints the number of players in a generic sports team using the getName method.
Soccer Class:

Inherits from Sports.
Overrides the getName method to return "Soccer Class".
Overrides the getNumberOfTeamMembers method to print that each soccer team has 11 players.
Solution Class:

Creates instances of Sports and Soccer.
Prints the name of the sport and the number of team members for both instances.
This code demonstrates the use of method overriding in Java and how a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method inherited from a superclass.


import java.util.*;
class Sports{

    String getName(){
        return "Generic Sports";
    }
  
    void getNumberOfTeamMembers(){
        System.out.println( "Each team has n players in " + getName() );
    }
}

class Soccer extends Sports{
    @Override
    String getName(){
        return "Soccer Class";
    }

    // Write your overridden getNumberOfTeamMembers method here
    @Override
   void getNumberOfTeamMembers(){
    System.out.println( "Each team has 11 players in " + getName() );
}

}

public class Solution{
	
    public static void main(String []args){
        Sports c1 = new Sports();
        Soccer c2 = new Soccer();
        System.out.println(c1.getName());
        c1.getNumberOfTeamMembers();
        System.out.println(c2.getName());
        c2.getNumberOfTeamMembers();
	}
}
