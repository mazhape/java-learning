We define the following:

A subarray of an -element array is an array composed from a contiguous block of the original array's elements. For example, if , then the subarrays are , , , , , and . Something like  would not be a subarray as it's not a contiguous subsection of the original array.
The sum of an array is the total sum of its elements.
An array's sum is negative if the total sum of its elements is negative.
An array's sum is positive if the total sum of its elements is positive.
Given an array of  integers, find and print its number of negative subarrays on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the length of array .
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing each respective element, , in array .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the number of subarrays of  having negative sums.

Sample Input

5
1 -2 4 -5 1
Sample Output

9
Explanation

There are nine negative subarrays of :

Thus, we print  on a new line.

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
    }
}

Explanation:
Reading Input:

We read the size of the array n and then the array elements into array.
Counting Negative Subarrays:

We use two nested loops:
The outer loop (with variable start) sets the starting index of the subarray.
The inner loop (with variable end) extends the subarray to include elements from start to end.
We calculate the sum of the current subarray by adding the element at the end index to sum.
If the sum is negative, we increment the negativeSubarraysCount.
Printing Result:

Finally, we print the count of negative subarrays.
This approach ensures we check all possible subarrays efficiently and count those with negative sums.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        scanner.close();

        int negativeSubarrays = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                sum += arr[j];
                if (sum < 0) {
                    negativeSubarrays++;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(negativeSubarrays);
    }
