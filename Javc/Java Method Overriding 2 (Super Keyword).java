When a method in a subclass overrides a method in superclass, it is still possible to call the overridden method using super keyword. If you write super.func() to call the function func(), it will call the method that was defined in the superclass.

You are given a partially completed code in the editor. Modify the code so that the code prints the following text:

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;


class BiCycle{
	String define_me(){
		return "a vehicle with pedals.";
	}
}

class MotorCycle extends BiCycle{
	String define_me(){
		return "a cycle with an engine.";
	}
	
	MotorCycle(){
		System.out.println("Hello I am a motorcycle, I am "+ define_me());

		String temp=define_me(); //Fix this line

		System.out.println("My ancestor is a cycle who is "+ temp );
	}
	
}
class Solution{
	public static void main(String []args){
		MotorCycle M=new MotorCycle();
	}
}


Explanation:
In the MotorCycle constructor, super.define_me() is used to call the define_me method from the superclass BiCycle.
This ensures that the output will first display the overridden method from MotorCycle, and then the original method from BiCycle.
