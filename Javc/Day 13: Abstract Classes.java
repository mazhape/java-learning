Task
Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:

Inherits from Book
Has a parameterized constructor taking these  parameters:
string 
string 
int 
Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these  lines:
, a space, and then the current instance's .
, a space, and then the current instance's .
, a space, and then the current instance's .
Note: Because these classes are being written in the same file, you must not use an access modifier (e.g.: ) when declaring MyBook or your code will not execute.

Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The Solution class creates a Book object and calls the MyBook class constructor (passing it the necessary arguments). It then calls the display method on the Book object.

Output Format

The  method should print and label the respective , , and  of the MyBook object's instance (with each value on its own line) like so:

Title: $title
Author: $author
Price: $price
Note: The  is prepended to variable names to indicate they are placeholders for variables.

Sample Input



import java.util.*;

abstract class Book {
    String title;
    String author;
    
    Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }
    
    abstract void display();
}

// Declare your class here. Do not use the 'public' access modifier.
    // Declare the price instance variable
    
    /**   
    *   Class Constructor
    *   
    *   @param title The book's title.
    *   @param author The book's author.
    *   @param price The book's price.
    **/
    // Write your constructor here
    
    /**   
    *   Method Name: display
    *   
    *   Print the title, author, and price in the specified format.
    **/
    // Write your method here
    
// End class

public class Solution {
   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String title = scanner.nextLine();
        String author = scanner.nextLine();
        int price = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        Book book = new MyBook(title, author, price);
        book.display();
    }
}


Explanation:
Book Class:

An abstract class with title and author instance variables.
A constructor to initialize title and author.
An abstract method display().
MyBook Class:

Extends the Book class.
Has an additional price instance variable.
The constructor initializes title, author, and price.
Implements the display method to print the book's details in the specified format.
Solution Class:

Reads input values for title, author, and price.
Creates an instance of MyBook.
Calls the display method to print the details.
This structure ensures the MyBook class correctly inherits from Book and implements the required functionality.

import java.util.*;

abstract class Book {
    String title;
    String author;
    
    Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }
    
    abstract void display();
}

// Declare your class here. Do not use the 'public' access modifier.
    class MyBook extends Book {
    // Declare the price instance variable
    int price;

    /**   
    *   Class Constructor
    *   
    *   @param title The book's title.
    *   @param author The book's author.
    *   @param price The book's price.
    **/
    MyBook(String title, String author, int price) {
        super(title, author);
        this.price = price;
    }
    
    /**   
    *   Method Name: display
    *   
    *   Print the title, author, and price in the specified format.
    **/
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Title: " + title);
        System.out.println("Author: " + author);
        System.out.println("Price: " + price);
    }
}
    
public class Solution {
   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String title = scanner.nextLine();
