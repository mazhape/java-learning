class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Private variable

    // Constructor
    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance > 0) {
            balance = initialBalance;
        }
    }

    // Getter
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    // Method to withdraw money
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds or invalid amount.");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);
        account.deposit(500);
        System.out.println("Current balance: " + account.getBalance());

        account.withdraw(200);
        System.out.println("Current balance after withdrawal: " + account.getBalance());

        account.withdraw(2000); // Attempt to withdraw more than the balance
    }}Summary In this example,

    the BankAccount

    class encapsulates
    the balance
    attribute. It provides public methods for depositing,withdrawing,
    and checking
    the balance while
    keeping the
    balance variable private.
    This prevents
    direct modification
    from outside the class,
    ensuring that
    any changes
    to the
    account balance
    go through
    the defined methods,
    maintaining control
    and consistency.

    Certainly.Let's
    focus on
    one crucial
    aspect of
    tightly encapsulated classes that's
    particularly relevant for
    the OCA Java 8 exam:
    the proper
    use of
    getter and
    setter methods.
    Getter and
    Setter Methods
    in Tightly
    Encapsulated Classes:

    Purpose:

    Getters:
    Provide controlled
    access to private fields.Setters:
    Allow controlled
    modification of
    private fields.


Naming Convention:

    Getters:
    Usually named

    getFieldName() (e.g., getName())
Setters: Usually named

    setFieldName(Type value) (e.g.,

    setName(String name))
Boolean getters may use isFieldName() (e.g., isActive())


Implementation:
javaCopypublic class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 0) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}

Exam Considerations:

The exam may test your ability to identify correctly implemented getters and setters.
Be aware that not all fields need both getters and setters. Some may have only getters (read-only) or only setters (write-only).
Setters often include validation logic to ensure data integrity.


Common Pitfalls:

Using

        public fields instead of
        private fields with getters/setters.
Incorrect method

        signatures (e.g., wrong return type for getters).
Missing access

        modifiers (methods should typically be public).


Immutability:

For immutable fields, provide only a getter, no setter.
Example:
javaCopyprivate final String id;

public String getId() {
    return id;
}

Performance Considerations:

The exam
might touch
on the
fact that
direct field
access is
slightly faster
than using getters/setters,
but encapsulation
is generally preferred for
maintainability and flexibility.

Remember,
the OCA
exam focuses
on basic
Java concepts, so while
you should
understand these principles,you won't
be tested
on advanced
design patterns
or complex
scenarios involving
encapsulation.The key
is to
recognize properly
encapsulated classes
and identify
violations of
encapsulation principles.
Would you

to provide
some practice
questions related to this
topic that
might appear
on the
OCA Java 8 exam?
